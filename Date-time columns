1) Convert 'string' type 'date' column to 'date-time' format.

syntax:
column_name::timestamp

2) when we perform arithmetic on date columns, result is of INTERVAL datatype

example: 
(2020-10-22 00:00:00) - (2020-10-10 00:00:00) = 12 days (instead of '12')

3) We can set the interval as per the requirement

example: 
we want to have the difference of two columns less than 10 days

syntax: (Assuming both columns are of date types, if not convert them)
column1 <= column2 + INTERVAL '10 days' as diff_col
